# ðŸ’¼ Salary Prediction Using Decision Tree & Random Forest Regressors

This project uses supervised machine learning techniques to predict salary based on years of experience. It includes exploratory data analysis, model training using **Decision Tree Regressor** and **Random Forest Regressor**, and performance evaluation. The project demonstrates the practical use of regression algorithms and highlights the importance of model interpretability and accuracy.

## Evaluation Metrics

| Model              | MAE   | MSE   | RMSE  | RÂ² Score |
|-------------------|-------|-------|-------|----------|
| Decision Tree      | 0.22  | 0.12  | 0.35  | 0.88     |
| Random Forest      | 0.11  | 0.05  | 0.23  | 0.95     |

Random Forest performs better due to ensemble learning, offering more accurate and stable predictions compared to a single Decision Tree.
