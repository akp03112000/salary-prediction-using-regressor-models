# ðŸ’¼ Salary Prediction Using Decision Tree & Random Forest Regressors

This project uses supervised machine learning techniques to predict salary based on years of experience. It includes exploratory data analysis, model training using **Decision Tree Regressor** and **Random Forest Regressor**, and performance evaluation. The project demonstrates the practical use of regression algorithms and highlights the importance of model interpretability and accuracy.

## Evaluation Metrics

| Model                | MAE   | MSE   | RMSE  | RÂ² Score |
|---------------------|-------|-------|-------|----------|
| Decision Tree        | 0.90  | 1.70  | 1.30  | 0.96     |
| Random Forest        | 0.70  | 1.00  | 1.00  | 0.98     |

Random Forest performs better due to ensemble learning.
